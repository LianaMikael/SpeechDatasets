# SpeechDatasets 

A collection of large publically available speech datasets for biometric speaker identification, veriffication and diarization, voice cloning, speech enhancement and denoising tasks. Because most audio datasets focus on speech-to-text domain, the motivation was to separate speech datasets for solving text-independent tasks.  

* [VoxCeleb](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/) - audio-visual dataset collected from interviews of famous people; consists of over 7000 speakers of different ethnicities, accents, and ages; 2000 hours of data collected in real-world environmets with backgroud noises. 

* [VoxMovies](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxmovies/) - audio dataset with 856 speakers from the VoxCeleb dataset with varying emotion,accents and noise.  

* [VCTK](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3443) - 48kHz audio dataset consisting of 110 speakers with different accents reading the same 400 sentences.    

* [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12) - 1000 hours of 16kHz audio data, contains both clean and noisy examples. 

* [TIMIT](https://www.kaggle.com/mfekadu/darpa-timit-acousticphonetic-continuous-speech) - 16kHz audio data of 630 speakers, each reading 10 identical sentences.
